/**
 * The listener interface for receiving keyboard events (keystrokes).
 * The class that is interested in processing a keyboard event
 * either implements this interface (and all the methods it
 * contains) or extends the abstract <code>KeyAdapter</code> class
 * (overriding only the methods of interest).
 * <p/>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addKeyListener</code>
 * method. A keyboard event is generated when a key is pressed, released,
 * or typed. The relevant method in the listener
 * object is then invoked, and the <code>KeyEvent</code> is passed to it.
